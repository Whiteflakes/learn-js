Exercise: unique

Goal: return a new array containing the unique elements from the input array, preserving first-occurrence order.

Contract
- Input: array (may be empty)
- Output: new array with duplicates removed (shallow equality)

Hints
- `Set` preserves insertion order and removes dupes for primitive values.
- Do not mutate the input array.

Tests
- A supplied test file checks common cases.
