# Capstone projects to solidify skills

- Minimal JS engine instrumentation: build a tiny app that is heavily instrumented (tracing, flame graphs) and add hooks to export traces.
- TypeScript language plugin: small tsserver plugin that adds a custom refactor or quickfix.
- Tiny bundler + plugin system: implement plugins for transforms (e.g., replace env vars) and a loader for CSS.
- Worker scheduling simulator: create a small benchmark harness comparing worker threads, child processes, and a cooperative scheduler.

Each project should be implemented in `exercises/projects/<project-name>/` and include a README, runnable scripts, and tests where possible.
