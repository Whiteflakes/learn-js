# Exercise: bindAll (call/apply/bind)

Goal: create helper that returns methods bound to their original object.

Contract
- `bindAll(obj, fnNames)` returns a new object with the listed function names bound to `obj`.

Notes
- This demonstrates `Function.prototype.bind`. You can extend the exercise to use `call` and `apply`.
