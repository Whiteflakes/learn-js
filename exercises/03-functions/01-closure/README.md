# Exercise: makeCounter (closures)

Goal: demonstrate lexical closures by returning a function that captures internal state.

Contract
- Input: optional start value (number)
- Output: a function that when called increments the captured counter by an optional delta value and returns the new value.

Tests verify that multiple counters have independent state.
