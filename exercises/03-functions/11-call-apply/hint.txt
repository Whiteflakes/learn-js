Common pitfalls:
- Forgetting to handle `null`/`undefined` thisArg (should default to globalThis).
- Not deleting the temporary property after calling the function.
- Using a plain string key can clash with existing properties; use Symbol for safety.

If your test fails, check those points and re-run `npm test`.
